# amnesty_nso_domain_list
This is just a generated list from the original repo (https://github.com/AmnestyTech/investigations/), where I scrap all the domains and push here. 


## How I generate this repo :

1. ```git clone https://github.com/AmnestyTech/investigations/```
2. ```cd investigations```
3. ```cat */*domains.txt | sort | uniq  | tee -a amensty_nso_domain_list.txt```

In all honesty you wont need this repo at all. I am maintaining this for my reference. You can choose not to trust me and generate the list yourself.

If you want I would be more than glad if you use this list along with your existing ad-blocker.
